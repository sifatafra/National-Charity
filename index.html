        <h2>We Provide</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to make sure people experiencing homelessness stay safe from the coronavirus. Many people without
            homes spend their time outdoors with no access to the care and hygienic resources that can protect them, or
            in “congregate” shelters, or shelters with many people in a small space. In both cases, having a home would
            make them much safer, especially during a viral pandemic. The Alliance is also partnering with federal
            policymakers, researchers, and service providers to help mitigate a potential new wave of homelessness
            resulting from the drastic economic impacts of this pandemic.</p>
